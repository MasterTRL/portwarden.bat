# portwarden.bat
A batch that makes using Portwarden a bit easier

Portwarden is a pretty cool project that allows you to create and handle encrypted backups of a Bitwarden Vault. This batch makes using portwarden a bit easier.

All you need to do is to download the portwarden.exe and the bw.exe, put them and the portwarden.bat together in the same folder and start the portwarden.bat. 
It will allow you to perform a backup, decrypte an encrypted backup and even restore a backup into a blank bitwarden account.

portwarden.exe can be downloaded here:  https://github.com/vwxyzjn/portwarden/releases/
bw.exe can be downloaded here:          https://github.com/bitwarden/cli/releases
